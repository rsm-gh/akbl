#       The configuration file allows to easily add and modify regions. The template for it is the following:        #

# DESCRIPTION= <DESCRIPTION>																						 #
# BLOCK= <INTEGER>																								     #

# -> The <UNIQUE_REGION_NAME> is only used for parsing the configuration file. Any unique name can be added.		 #
#																													 #
# -> ID is the field used by the software to order the regions in the interface. The only two id's that should		 #
#    not be changed are PB and PBE. New Id's can be created.				    							         #
